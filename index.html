		<h1>I agree</h1>
		<p>What is the future story of Story?<br>Story — or maybe more properly, storytelling — is the new black. It seems that leaders everywhere are concerned about telling a better story, individuals are aware of the need for a personal brand story and political campaigns are raising our awareness of what happens when stories become polarised and crash into each other. The trend towards seeing everything as a story means we are are challenged on two levels — first that we are overwhelmed by a fragmentation of stories in every possible media, and secondly that we start to see storytelling as simply the latest fad or the most shiny tool in the box.

As many who work with the subtleties of communication and human nature warn us — a bulldozer is simply a tool, it depends on what your intention is in using it. Do you want to tear down the house or do you want to build a road? The same tool can do both of these things. It can be destructive and it can be constructive — it all depends on how you choose to use it. And the awareness and skill of the user makes the difference. A hammer can be used to create something both purposeful and beautiful or it can make a mess of both the object it is used on and the one swinging it.</p>
